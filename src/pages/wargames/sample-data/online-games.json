It will teach the\nbasics needed to be able to play other wargames. <strong>If you notice\nsomething essential is missing or have ideas for new levels, please let\nus know!</strong></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"note-for-beginners\">Note for beginners</h2>\n\n<p>This game, like most other games, is organised in levels. You start at\nLevel 0 and try to “beat” or “finish” it. Finishing a level results in\ninformation on how to start the next level. The pages on this website\nfor “Level &lt;X&gt;” contain information on how to start level X from the\nprevious level. E.g. The page for <a href=\"/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html\">Level 1</a> has information on how to\ngain access from <a href=\"/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html\">Level 0</a> to <a href=\"/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html\">Level 1</a>. All levels in this game\nhave a page on this website, and they are all linked to from the\nsidemenu on the left of this page.</p>\n\n<p>You will encounter many situations in which you have no idea what you\nare supposed to do. <strong>Don’t panic! Don’t give up!</strong> The purpose of this\ngame is for you to learn the basics. Part of learning the basics, is\nreading a lot of new information. If you’ve never used the command line\nbefore, a good first read is this <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/intro.1.html\">introduction to user commands</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are several things you can try when you are unsure how to\ncontinue:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>First, if you know a command, but don’t know how to use it, try the\n<strong>manual</strong> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page\">man page</a>) by entering <strong>man &lt;command&gt;</strong>.\nFor example, <strong>man ls</strong> to learn about the “ls” command.\nThe “man” command also has a manual, try it!\nWhen using <strong>man</strong>, press <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">q</code> to quit\n(you can also use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">N</code> to search).</li>\n  <li>Second, if there is no man page, the command might be a <strong>shell\nbuilt-in</strong>. In that case use the “<strong>help &lt;X&gt;</strong>” command. E.g. help\ncd</li>\n  <li>Also, your favorite <strong>search-engine</strong> is your friend. Learn how to\nuse it! I recommend <a href=\"https://www.google.com\">Google</a>.</li>\n  <li>Lastly, if you are still stuck, you can <a href=\"#/contact\">join us via chat</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’re ready to start! Begin with <a href=\"/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html\">Level 0</a>, linked at the left of\nthis page. Good luck!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note for VMs:</strong> You may fail to connect to overthewire.org via SSH with a “<em>broken pipe error</em>” when the network adapter for the VM is configured to use NAT mode. Adding the setting <strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">IPQoS throughput</code></strong> to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/etc/ssh/ssh_config</code> should resolve the issue. If this does not solve your issue, the only option then is to change the adapter to Bridged mode.</p>\n\n\n</div>",
