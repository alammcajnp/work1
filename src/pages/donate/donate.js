                            Intercept Security is a security company with a single goal: bringing simplicity to
                            Security. We build Fast Intercept â€“ a security automation product that helps bring the
                            technology to organizations what would otherwise not be able to afford or support such a
                            solution. We also provide consulting services and engineering to help teams lower their
                            costs, improve their security posture, and reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) of
                            security incident response. We love (Love-love) overthewire as a training tool and its
                            spirit in the community as a whole and are happy to support.
